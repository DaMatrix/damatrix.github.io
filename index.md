Hi! I'm **DaPorkchop_**, and this is my website. I'm a 15-year-old from Switzerland, and I've spent so much time coding ~~while I'm supposed to be studying~~ that I've gotten pretty damn good at it!

I'm an active mem(b)er of the one and only [Team Pepsi](http://pepsi.team), and single-handedly made pepsimod and the __mc.pepsi.team__ Minecraft server network.

I'm very active in the Minecraft modding community, and have contributed to numerous mods, mostly [Valkyrien Warfare](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/valkyrien-warfare).

The majority of my projects recently have been inspired by Minecraft server [2b2t](http://2b2t.org), a server with no rules, no admins and lots of potential things to be coded.  I'm probably known best from my weekly render series on [/r/2b2t](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/) (a library of which can be found [here](http://cloud.daporkchop.net/misc/tobetote/weekly/))

As an average middle-schooler, I can't always spend as much time as I'd like coding. Feel free to buy me a ~~beer~~ Pepsi or just support my work by donating crypto using one of the addresses down below.

Thanks for reading this, and feel free to have a look around!
