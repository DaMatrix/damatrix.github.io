<h3>2p2e is <strong>DEAD</strong>.</h3>
<p>It's too much work for me to maintain, costs me over $300 a month in power bills alone, and NOBODY has donated, making it impossible for me to be able to keep up with the costs. I'm completely abandoning MCPE and moving back to where I was before, the MCPC modding community. If anybody wants to see what I get up to, then check you the new <a href="http://discord.gg/BY3Q69x">Discord</a> where I'll be hanging out from here on out. It's been a great time getting to know you all. Well, this has been DaPorkchop_, and I'm out.</p>
