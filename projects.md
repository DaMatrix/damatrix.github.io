# Projects

This page contains some of the biggest and most noteworthy projects I've worked on, but isn't particularly complete or up-to-date. Consider taking a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/DaMatrix) and [the PorkStudios GitHub org](https://github.com/PorkStudios)!

### 2020-Present [Terra++](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth/terraplusplus)

A Minecraft mod which generates the entire earth at 1:1 scale in Minecraft, originally forked from terra121. I completely rewrote the entire dataset and generation pipeline myself, making everything both data-driven and fully parallel and asynchronous. From my benchmarks, it's able to generate an identical area nearly 40 times faster than terra121, along with significantly increased terrain quality.

### 2020-Present [FarPlaneTwo](https://github.com/PorkStudios/FarPlaneTwo)

A work-in-progress Minecraft mod which implements continious Level-of-Detail rendering, with the end goal being to be able to use render distances thousands of times higher than what's possible in the vanilla game.

### 2018-Present [SaveSearcher](https://github.com/DaMatrix/SaveSearcher)

A standalone tool I made for datamining Minecraft worlds. I've put a ton of work into optimizing it thoroughly, and as a result it runs extremely fast. It's able to do a full scan of a 300GiB world with 15 modules enabled in just under 4 hours - on an i7-2635QM.

### 2018-Present [Cloudburst](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Server) (formerly NukkitX)

A from-scratch server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. I've done a lot of work on this, most significantly a clean-room terrain generator which is entirely driven by dozens of configuration files.

### 2018-Present [PorkLib](https://github.com/PorkStudios/PorkLib)

A collection of Java libraries which I use in most of my code. PorkLib has taken by *far* the most time of anything else on this list, and despite my best efforts to keep it trimmed down, the codebase has become quite large, with a total of over 30 individual modules.

### 2017-2020 [PorkBot](https://github.com/DaMatrix/PorkBot)

A Discord bot I made that reached over 2200 servers. Unfortunately, a number of features have stopped working, and I haven't had enough time to keep on top of it, but it's still online, and I intend to revamp it at some point.

### 2017-2019 [Valkyrien Skies](https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Valkyrien-Skies)

*Moving structures powered by a custom multi-threaded physics engine; in Minecraft.*
