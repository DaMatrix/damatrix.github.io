# Projects

## [Valkyrien Warfare](https://github.com/ValkyrienWarfare/Valkyrien-Warfare-Revamped)

A Minecraft mod made by [thebest108 (aka BigBastard)](https://github.com/Best108) and I. Inspired by Archimedes' Ships, but far better.  Features: Walking on and interacting with moving ships, nearly full mod compatibility, and realistic physics!  By far my favorite project, although I haven't found much time to work on it as of late.

## [pepsimod](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimod)

A hacked Minecraft client that works as a Forge mod. It doesn't have many hacks, but a number of useful utilities for automating boring gameplay mechanics.

## [BetterMapArt](https://github.com/DaMatrix/betterMapArt)

A better map art generator for Minecraft. (WIP)

## PorkAI

Currently in planning, nowhere near release

A simple-to-use API for making self-learning neural networks.

## [Pork2b2tBot](https://github.com/DaMatrix/Pork2b2tBot)

A Minecraft bot and proxy, designed for bypassing the queue on [2b2t](http://2b2t.org).

## [PorkBot](https://github.com/DaMatrix/PorkBot)

A Discord bot with lots of useful commands, mostly Minecraft-related.

## [speedboost](https://github.com/DaMatrix/speedboost)

A Minecraft Forge mod that allows using a number of performance-increasing settings that otherwise were only avalible with Spigot.
