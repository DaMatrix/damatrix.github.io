# Projects

This is a list of some projects I've made, along with an indicator as to how much work I'm putting into them currently.

## [PorkLib](https://porklib.daporkchop.net) **ACTIVE**

A number of Java libraries for making things that I use on a regular basis less of a pain.

## [Valkyrien Warfare](https://github.com/ValkyrienWarfare/Valkyrien-Warfare-Revamped)  **ON HOLD**

A Minecraft mod made by [thebest108 (aka BigBastard)](https://github.com/Best108) and I. Inspired by Archimedes' Ships, but far better. Features: Walking on and interacting with moving ships, nearly full mod compatibility, and realistic physics! By far my favorite project, although I haven't found much time to work on it as of late.

## [pepsimod](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimod)  **SEMI-ACTIVE**

A hacked Minecraft client that works as a Forge mod. It doesn't have many hacks, but a number of useful utilities for automating boring gameplay mechanics.

## [BetterMapArt](https://github.com/DaMatrix/betterMapArt)  **ON HOLD**

A better map art generator for Minecraft. (WIP)

## PorkAI  **PLANNING**

Currently in planning, nowhere near release

A simple-to-use API for making self-learning neural networks.

## [CoffeeCash](https://github.com/CoffeeCash/CoffeeCash) **PLANNING, ON HOLD**

Intended to be a simple, from-scratch implementation of a cryptocurrency in Java. Currently this is still waiting for me to finsh work on PorkLib's database and p2p networking modules.

## [CubeCentric](https://github.com/CubeCentric/CubeCentric) **PLANNING, ON HOLD**

A decentralized Minecraft server. I'm still writing a (((whitepaper))) and need to finish CoffeeCash before I really make any attempt at this.

## [Pork2b2tBot](https://github.com/DaMatrix/Pork2b2tBot)  **STABLE, FEATURE-COMPLETE**

A Minecraft bot and proxy, designed for bypassing the queue on [2b2t](http://2b2t.org).

## [PorkBot](https://github.com/DaMatrix/PorkBot)  **STABLE, FEATURE-COMPLETE**

A Discord bot with lots of useful commands, mostly Minecraft-related.

## [speedboost](https://github.com/DaMatrix/speedboost)  **STABLE**

A Minecraft Forge mod that allows using a number of performance-increasing settings that otherwise were only avalible with Spigot.



I don't really have much time to update this on a regular basis and a lot of my smaller projects aren't even worth mentioning here. Have a look at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/DaMatrix) for a more complete list.
